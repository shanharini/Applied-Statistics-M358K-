Before embarking on this project, go to [Wikipedia: the Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem). This Wikipedia entry contains the description of the original Monty Hall problem as well as its analysis and variations. 

---

## Problem #1. **(10 points)**
Read and understand the description of the original Monty Hall game. Now, write down your own description in your own words. Resist the temptation to copy-paste from an external resource since that will earn you zero points. It might help to imagine that you have a five-year old niece or nephew you are describing the game to. 

```{r}
writeLines("")


```

## Problem #2. **(10 points)**
Write and execute code in `R` which will represent **one round** of the original Monty Hall game. More precisely, it should do the following:

- "choose" at random behind which door the prize will be,

- "choose" at random the door that the contestant picks,

- choose which door the host will open,

- determine whether it was optimal to **switch** or **stick** for this particular round and return this determination. 
```{r}
montyhall <- function(){
  choices <- 1:3
  car <- sample(choices, 1)
  my_choice <- sample(choices, 1)
  host <- sample(choices[choices != car & choices != my_choice], 1)
  if (car == my_choice){
    return ("stick")
  }else{
    return("switch")
  }
}

montyhall()
```

## Problem #3. **(10 points)**
Write and execute code in `R` which repeats 100 rounds of the Monty Hall game. For which proportion of these rounds was it optimal to **switch**? *Hint:* If you answer to the previous problem was not in the form of a function, make it so now. 

```{r}
proportion <- function(n){
  sticks <- 0
  switches <- 0
  for (i in 1:n){
    if (montyhall() == "switch"){
      switches <- switches + 1
    }
  }
  print(switches/100)
}

proportion(100)

```

## Problem #4 **(10 points)**
Write and execute code in `R` which repeats $n$ rounds of the Monty Hall game for $n=100, 110, 120, ..., 10000$. For each $n$, your code should record the proportion of individual rounds for which it was optimal to **switch**. In `R`, plot this recorded proportion as a function of $n$. 
Does your computational result agree with the analysis available at [Wikipedia: the Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem)? Why? It might also be useful to consult: [Wikipedia: The Law of Large Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers). 

```{r}

b <- list()
for(i in seq(100,200, 100)){
  prop <- proportion(i)
  b
}

```
